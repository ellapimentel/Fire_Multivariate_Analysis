# Predicting Future Fires 
### A multivariate time series analysis predicting future fires using temperature and precipitation data. 

*Fires have been increasing in destruction and prevalence in the West Coast areas of the US. The summer of 2020 has been the worst year of fires by far and is making a lot of people rethink living in California or in heavily forested areas. With fires now turning into an expected seasonal occurance, we want to build a model that can help predict the possibility of a fire depending on temperature and precipitation in nearby areas. Since there are a lot of factors to weather and fire, it will be a challenge to come up with a model that can accurately predict when, where, and how many fires may occur given a set of weather criteria, but we will do our best to use a multivariate time series analysis to forecast future fires.*
